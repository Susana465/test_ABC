Warning: total probability of reaction is > 1 (36.7904)
rxn class for reactants: 
    B@CP (4) + A@CP (3)
  pathways were not initialized
0: products based on rule A + B -> C 1e+10 (id: 0)
    C (5) 
cum_probs: 36.7904, max_fixed_p: 36.7904
Warning: Some reactions were missed because total reaction probability exceeded 1.
  A + B  --  97.293% of reactions missed.
Warning: There was a bimolecular reaction with probability p > 1.0. This means that some reactions were missed. See report file reports\warnings_report_00002.txt for more details. A shorter time step may be needed.
Additional details may be found in reports\rxn_report_00002.txt, if it does not exist, it can be enabled by setting 'rxn_and_species_report' to true.
