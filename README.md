# How to use files in this repository

This is a toy repo where I create equivalent models of my thesis project. I test the files here with models that run a lot faster and are much simpler than my dodecamer one. 

There might be some files that are saved as tests outside of the main ones, as I try out different things.

The important files to run the simulation are:

- [`mcell_params.py`](define_simulation_params.py)
- [`prepare_run_files.py`](mcell_ABC.py)
- [`run_python_files.py`](run_python_files.py)
- [`test_ABC.bngl`](test_ABC.bngl)
