# What is in this repository

This is a toy repo where I create equivalent models of my thesis project. I test the files here with models that run a lot faster and are much simpler than my dodecamer one. 

There might be some files that are saved as tests outside of the main ones, as I try out different things.

The important files to run the simulation are:

## Parameter files:
- [`mcell_params.py`](mcell_params.py): where variable mcell parameters are stored, and can be changed.
- [`test_ABC.bngl`](test_ABC.bngl)

## Run-the-model files:
- [`prepare_run_files.py`](prepare_run_files.py): script that prepares files to be copied, ran, and saved in a timestamped folder.
- [`run_python_files.py`](run_python_files.py): script executor that automates the execution of the other Python scripts.

## Output files
- `data_output/`: contains timestamped folder that is created with scripts mentioned above. Each timestamped folder contains the outputs from running the python scripts.
